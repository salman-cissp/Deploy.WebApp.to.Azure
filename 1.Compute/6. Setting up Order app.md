This app doesn't have a front-end. It works in the back-end to process the orders sent to the shopping cart. It will be deployed as a serverless app (function). Its functionality cant be tested directly from a web browser like the other apps , so we will have to use another app called 'Postman API'

- add 'order' app to the project
- install 'postman api platform' (to test http trigger) app on local pc 
- compile and test by running locally
