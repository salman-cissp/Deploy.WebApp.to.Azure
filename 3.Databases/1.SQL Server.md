- create new sql db ``readitdbserver-s
- enable public access 
- Connect to catalog app
	- add the db connection string in appsettings.json
	 ![[Pasted image 20230513140436.png]]
	- disable in-memory db
	 ![[Pasted image 20230513140540.png]]
	- create table
	 ![[Pasted image 20230513140917.png]]
	 - create this table in azure database	 ![[Pasted image 20230513141158.png]]
	 - Books table created
	 ![[Pasted image 20230513141436.png]]
	 - build code locally, add books to db
	 ![[Pasted image 20230513141719.png]]
	 - check if records were added
	 ![[Pasted image 20230513141817.png]]
	 - this means catalog app is working and successfully connecting to azure db
	 - publish it again
		 - stop web server
		 - copy the contents of publish folder to web server
		 - start web server
	 - connect to catalog via the app gateway public on port 8080
	 - wont be able to connect
	 ![[Pasted image 20230513201220.png]]
	 - add public ip of catalog-vm pip to the firewall rule in sql database server
	![[Pasted image 20230513201843.png]]
	- should work now	 
	 ![[Pasted image 20230513202533.png]]
	 - another another layer of security by setting service end point between the db and catalog vm
		 - ``readit-app-vnet`` to ``default`` subnet of ``catalog-vm``
		 ![[Pasted image 20230513202955.png]]
		 - in db, add existing vnet in firewall
		 ![[Pasted image 20230513203206.png]]
		 ![[Pasted image 20230513203226.png]]
		 - previous catalog-vm rule can now be removed
		 ![[Pasted image 20230513203343.png]]
		 - make sure catalog-vm can still connect to the db(using service-endpoints)
		 ![[Pasted image 20230513203508.png]]
	 
- Connecting Inventory to DB
	- inventory code in VS Code
		- uncomment
		![[Pasted image 20230514110559.png]]
		- deploy and publish to web
		![[Pasted image 20230514110825.png]]
		![[Pasted image 20230514110918.png]]
		- check inventory app @ ``https://readit-inventory-s.azurewebsites.net/
		![[Pasted image 20230514111234.png]]
		- thos errror is because of this:
		![[Pasted image 20230514111355.png]]
		- we need to add the connection string to the web app, but not in the code
		![[Pasted image 20230514111631.png]]
		- now we get this error
		![[Pasted image 20230514111748.png]]
		- add the ip address to db firewall
		![[Pasted image 20230514111906.png]]
		- test it works
		![[Pasted image 20230514111958.png]]
		- change stock of one book
		![[Pasted image 20230514112341.png]]
		- test if catalog updates
		![[Pasted image 20230514112416.png]]
		- means both inventory & catalog are connected to the same azure sql db  and working fine
