Having connection strings in the code is very risky, to make it more secure we are going to store them in azure KeyVault
- KeyVault
	- create new![[Pasted image 20230518141159.png]]
	- connect via private endpoint![[Pasted image 20230518141348.png]]
	- Change catalog app code to support keyvault
		- ![[Pasted image 20230518141635.png]]
		- add diagnostic setting so we can see who accessed our secrets![[Pasted image 20230518142304.png]]
		- add firewall rule to allow access from local ip![[Pasted image 20230518142618.png]] 
		- define secret to define connection string
			- ![[Pasted image 20230518142808.png]]
			- copy the values from the code. Name is very important, it should match the values in the code![[Pasted image 20230518145657.png]]
			- copy vault uri![[Pasted image 20230518143648.png]]
			- remove the connection string from the code and add the keyvault![[Pasted image 20230518144021.png]]
			- build
			- test locally, should see this which means it can connect to the db via the keyvault and not the connection string![[Pasted image 20230518145812.png]]
			- deploy the code to catalog-vm IIS
			- you should get this error, because keyvault has no idea who we are![[Pasted image 20230518153849.png]]
				- add managed identity in catalog-vm![[Pasted image 20230518154018.png]]
				- give catalog-vm access to secret in keyvault![[Pasted image 20230518154820.png]]
				- test locally![[Pasted image 20230518161114.png]]
				- now check via public ip![[Pasted image 20230518161150.png]]
				- check the access history![[Pasted image 20230518161638.png]]
				- ![[Pasted image 20230518161704.png]]
- Security Center
	- check the recommendations![[Pasted image 20230518162548.png]]
	- check the alerts![[Pasted image 20230518162619.png]]
	- check all the inventory being monitor![[Pasted image 20230518163445.png]]
