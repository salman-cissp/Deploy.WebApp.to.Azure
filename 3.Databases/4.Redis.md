Setup for the shopping cart. When items are added to the cart from catalog, it will be stored in the redis

- create
	- ``readitredis0523

Connect to Catalog:
- VS Code
	- catalog
		- add connection string in 'appsettings.json'![[Pasted image 20230514195723.png]]
		- uncomment code in 'index.cshtml.cs'![[Pasted image 20230514195659.png]]
	- run locally
	- test
		- cart shows 3 items which were added previously![[Pasted image 20230514211444.png]]
		-remove one book![[Pasted image 20230514211710.png]]
		- catalog should now show 2 also ![[Pasted image 20230514211748.png]]
		
		
 - Publish to azure
	- web server on ``catalog-vm
		- stop server
		- copy published files from VS code to catalog folder 
		- start server
	- test
		- if it shows 2 books in the cart, it means it is connected to redis
		- add another book![[Pasted image 20230514200402.png]]
Connect to Cart:
- VS Code
	- cart
		- add connection string for redis & DB in 'appsettings.json'![[Pasted image 20230514205630.png]]
		- get 'Function Url' from ' ``ProcessOrderCosmos`` from function app and add to ``OrderFunctionUrl``!![[Pasted image 20230514210024.png]]
		- uncomment code in 'index.cshtml.cs'![[Pasted image 20230514210126.png]]
	 
 - Placing Order
	 - go to function ``ProcessOrderCosmos
		 - check logs while placing order from the cart 'Code+Text'![[Pasted image 20230515103108.png]]
		 - place order from the local code in VS Code![[Pasted image 20230515103204.png]]
		 - order is placed as the logs show![[Pasted image 20230515103239.png]]
		 - check Cosmos db which show the order![[Pasted image 20230515103650.png]]
		 - so far we are running the cart code locally, it needs to be from azure as a container
			 - build image![[Pasted image 20230515104007.png]]
			 - deploy to ACR![[Pasted image 20230515104344.png]]
			 - deploy to AKS
				 - ``kubectl apply -f deployment.yam
				 - test![[Pasted image 20230515104833.png]]
				 - ![[Pasted image 20230515104915.png]]
				 - add 2 books from catalog![[Pasted image 20230515105234.png]]
				 - now check the cart we just deployed in AKS![[Pasted image 20230515113059.png]]
				 	 
				 - that means docker image in AKS is connected to redis & azure sql db
				 - is it also connected to azure function which will place the order?
					 - place the order![[Pasted image 20230515115500.png]]
					 ![[Pasted image 20230515115636.png]]
					 
					 - check the logs in ``ProcessOrderCosmos`` function![[Pasted image 20230515115700.png]]
				- so we now have the catalog, inventory , cart and the order function all working together
				- The most important part is that we successfully connected redis to catalog and cart app ![[Pasted image 20230515120208.png]]
				- Are we done ?![[Pasted image 20230515120438.png]]
