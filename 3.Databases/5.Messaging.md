Instead of activating function though http trigger(public & synchronous), we use Event Grid(much safer & asynchronous) 
- Event Grid |System Topics
	- create
		- ``orders-topic``![[Pasted image 20230515184658.png]]
		- in ``order`` app replace ``ProcessOrderCosmos.cs`` with new one which supports event grid
		- add event grid support![[Pasted image 20230515185514.png]]
		- get connection string from ``ordersreadit0523`` storage account![[Pasted image 20230515185710.png]]
		- paste it in ``local.settings.json``![[Pasted image 20230515185835.png]]
		- copy connection string from ``readitfuncstorage0523`` storage account and paste into new entry in ``local.settings.json`` ![[Pasted image 20230515190224.png]]
		- deploy this function to ``readitfunctionapp0523``![[Pasted image 20230515190345.png]]
		- upload settings![[Pasted image 20230515190754.png]]
		- create event subscription & select our function as subscription to this topic
			- whenever event in storage account occurs, our function is going to trigger![[Pasted image 20230515192115.png]]
		- test
			- upload blob in storage account![[Pasted image 20230515193418.png]]
			- 
		- connect cart app to storage account so that when placing order the order will be saved in the storage account
			- replace ``index.cshtml.cs`` with new one in the cart app
			- we dont need OrderFuntionUrl anymore![[Pasted image 20230515194202.png]]
			- replace it with storage account connection string![[Pasted image 20230515194337.png]]
			- build![[Pasted image 20230515194539.png]]
			- test locally
			- open catalog, add 2 books![[Pasted image 20230515194736.png]]
			- check cart![[Pasted image 20230515194809.png]]
			- place order![[Pasted image 20230515194914.png]]
			- order is received![[Pasted image 20230515195050.png]]
			- function received the order![[Pasted image 20230515195205.png]]
			- order received in cosmos db![[Pasted image 20230515195252.png]]
		- publish cart app to AKS
			- build docker image in VS Code
			- push image to ACR as ver 1
			- update deployment.yaml with ver 1
			- deploy to AKS
			- test
				- add one book![[Pasted image 20230515200140.png]]
				- check the cart![[Pasted image 20230515200206.png]]
				- place order![[Pasted image 20230515200233.png]]
				- check neworders![[Pasted image 20230515200321.png]]
				- check function![[Pasted image 20230515200401.png]]
				- check cosmos db![[Pasted image 20230515200439.png]]
			- everything works fine
- Protecting the function (publicly available)
	- allow only from event grid![[Pasted image 20230515200851.png]]
